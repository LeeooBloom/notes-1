* can't design workflows without understanding how everybody is working
* it's not about tech, it's about tech enabling healthcare professionals to improve outcomes
* how can we disseminate healthcare information? we need to understand how healthcare is talked about in healthcare offices around the country
    * Talk to the pharmacists to know exactly what we need to show when we do analysis
* keep track of who has access to data, it might be a good idea not to store things
    * healthcare data isn't like all other kind of data
* find out who built the process, so we can work together and add technology to the process
* what are pain points in the system? need to watch people use our platform
    * what's your day like? walk me thru how you do this?
    * what do you hate?
    * what are your workarounds?
    * iterate to success
